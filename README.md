dotfiles
--------

This repo contains my configuration dotfiles. I may also add general new computer provisioning checklists and scripts.

I do contract work and clients often want me to use their equipment, so my goal here is to contain everything I need to get 80% comfy with a new Windows, Linux, or MacOS machine in 90 minutes or less.

### current contents:

- `.vimrc` (deprecated)
- `nvim/`

### current approach:

I spend a lot of time in Vim/NeoVim. I don't feel compelled to do _everything_ in it, but it is definitely my base-camp.

At home I use the `vimwiki` and `vim-zettel` plugins to organize the inputs and outputs of my digital life.

At work I use a more brutalist system that revolves around creating a batch of text files for each new gig.

Key principles:

1. no personal files on work computers
2. clear separation of confidential and non-confidential files
3. all configuration lives in one place that is easy to back-up
4. it should be quick to move most text to and from vim
5. hotkeys should be the same or similar regardless of OS
